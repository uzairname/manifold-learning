The "Arithmetic" task in tasks/arithmetic is the same model trained in the paper. I observe the same loss curve exhibiting grokking behavior.

Manifold learning on a synthetic dataset

The "Clock" task in tasks/clock trains an autoencoder on images of clocks with an hour and minute hand. The data is represented as a one dimensional manifold which develops folds and fractal-like structure as reconstruction loss decreases.
